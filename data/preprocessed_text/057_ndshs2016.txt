What is the National Drug Strategy Household 
Survey? 

• The 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey 
collects information on tobacco, alcohol and other 
drug use, attitudes and beliefs. 

• The survey is conducted about every three years 
and started in 1985. 

• It is managed by the Australian Institute of Health 
and Welfare (AIHW) on behalf of the Australian 
Government Department of Health. 

 
How confidential is the information I give you? 

• All answers you provide will be treated 
confidentially. 

• The research is carried out in compliance with the 
Privacy Act 1988 and the information is only used for 
research purposes. 

• The survey is conducted under the AIHW Act 1987, 
which prohibits the release of information about 
individuals collected in the survey. 

 
How will my answers be used? 

• Your answers will be used by researchers to help in 
understanding what people think about tobacco, 
alcohol and other drugs and how widely these drugs 
are used. 

• The answers you give will not be released to anyone 
(including the police). 

 
Do I have to participate in the survey? 

• Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary. 

• If there are any questions you do not want to answer 
for any reason, please leave that question blank. 

• It is important that you complete this questionnaire 
by yourself and be as honest and accurate as 
possible. 

2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey 

Are you 12 – 17 years old? 

• It is important that our younger respondents know 
that your answers will not be shown to anyone, 
this includes your parents. 

• Please don’t be afraid or embarrassed to give honest 
answers. 

• Your answers will simply become part of a bigger 
pool of answers and no one will know who you are. 

 
What do I do when I’ve completed the survey? 

• Once you have completed the survey, seal it in the 
envelope provided and a Roy Morgan Research 
fieldworker will return to collect it. 

• The fieldworker will then return the sealed envelope 
to the survey team for processing. 

• Only the survey team will have access to your form 
and once the survey data is compiled your form will 
be destroyed. 

• Your name and address will never be linked with any 
of the information you provide. 

 
How is the information processed? 

• All survey forms are coded so the researchers will 
not know who you are. Your answers will be grouped 
with the answers of over 22,000 other people before 
the researchers get to see them. 

• Researchers will use all these answers to show 
things like ‘most young people do not smoke’ or 
‘three quarters of women drink alcohol’. 

• When released in late-2017, the results of the survey 
will be available on the Institute’s website 
(www.aihw.gov.au).

Statistical Linkage Key 

Please read this: 

With your permission, we would like to collect some information from you so that your data from this survey and 
your data from other government records may be linked (i.e. combined) – but kept completely confidential.  
This data linking would only be for research purposes.   

This linking would be done by using a ‘Statistical Linkage Key’, which is simply a group of letters and numbers 
that contains enough information to link records for statistical analysis, but cannot be used to identify anyone.   

Answering this section is optional and entirely voluntary.  It is also completely confidential.  For more detail on 
confidentiality please see the information below.   

To answer this section, please go to the next page. 

 
Remember - Your confidentiality and privacy are protected 

• Your actual name and other personal details will NOT be used at all in the linking of your survey data to 
other government records. 

• No information from this survey will ever be added to any of your other government records.  

• The linking of this data will only ever be used for statistical purposes. It will never be used for any legal, 
administrative or other purposes.  

• Statistical reports will only contain combined information from many people and will not identify any 
individual.  

• All your responses are treated confidentially. The research is carried out in compliance with the Privacy 
Act 1988 and the information is used for research purposes only.  

• The AIHW has specific legislation (Section 29 of the AIHW Act 1987) which prevents identifiable 
information about you from being released to anyone. 

 

How to complete this:  

To create the Statistical Linkage Key, we need a few specific letters from both your first name and your 
surname.  Please print ONLY these letters in the boxes on the next page: the 2nd and 3rd letters of your first or 
given name, and the 2nd, 3rd and 5th letters of your surname (family name). 

EXAMPLE ONLY: 

Letters of family name: E N L 

Letters of given name: A O 

Letters of given name: 

Letters of family name: U I 2 

2 O 

e.g. if your name is DAVID JOHNSON you would write in: 

 
 
 
 
 
If your name isn’t long enough, use the number 2 for blank spaces. 
e.g. if your name is JO LIU, you would write in: 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not count hyphens, apostrophes or blank spaces. 
e.g. if your name is JO-ANNE O’NEIL, you would write in: 

Letters of family name: H O S 

Letters of given name: V A

What is data linkage? 

Data linkage refers to the bringing together of information from more than one source that relates to the same 
person. This allows researchers to tell a bigger story than analysing data from just one source. For example,  
comparing the data on women who received the HPV vaccination with data on women who developed cervical 
cancer provided strong evidence that overall, the vaccination was effective in reducing cervical cancer.
