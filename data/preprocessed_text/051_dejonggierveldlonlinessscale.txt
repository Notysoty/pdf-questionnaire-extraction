processing the scale data manually  

Step 1  

Count the neutral and positive answers ("more or less", "yes", or "yes!") on items 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10. This is the 

emotional loneliness score.  

Count the missing values (i.e., no answer) on items 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10. This is the missing emotional loneliness 

score.  

Count the neutral and negative ("no!", "no", or "more or less") answers on items 1, 4, 7, 8, 11. This is the 

social loneliness score.  

Count the missing values (i.e., no answer) on items 1, 4, 7, 8, 11. This is the missing social loneliness score.  

Step 2  

Compute the total loneliness score by taking the sum of the emotional loneliness score and the social 

loneliness score.  

Step 3  

The emotional loneliness score is valid only if the missing emotional loneliness score equals 0.  

The social loneliness score is valid only if the missing social loneliness score equals 0.  

The total loneliness score is valid only if the sum of the missing emotional loneliness score and the missing 

social loneliness score equals 0 or 1.  

Step 4  

If desired, the total loneliness score can be categorized into four levels: not lonely (score 0, 1 or 2), moderate 

lonely (score 3 through 8), severe lonely (score 9 or 10), and very severe lonely (score 11). 

 

 



8 A short scale  

A 6-item version for overall, emotional and social loneliness has been developed because the length of the 
11-item version has sometimes rendered it difficult to use the scale in large surveys. The construction and 
empirically testing is reported in De Jong Gierveld & Van Tilburg (2006). The selected items are: 

 
3. I experience a general sense of emptiness 
4. There are plenty of people I can rely on when I have problems 
7. There are many people I can trust completely 
9. I miss having people around 
8. There are enough people I feel close to 
10. I often feel rejected 

 
Whether to use the 11-item version or the shortened 6-item version of the loneliness scale is not a neutral 
decision. Whereas studies detailing the prevalence of loneliness, or in-depth studies of loneliness among 
certain individuals, as well as research into the changing nature and impact of loneliness after specific life 
events may benefit from using the 11-item scale, the use of the shortened 6-item loneliness scale may be 
sufficient in other studies. In both cases, however, the researcher has a reliable and valid measuring 
instrument at hand, which can be used as a unidimensional overall loneliness measure as well as provide 
information about the emotional and/or social loneliness situation of respondents.
