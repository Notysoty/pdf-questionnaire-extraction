When you think of the past 12 months, have you bet more than you could 
really afford to lose? 

This self-assessment is based on the Canadian Problem Gambling Index. 
It will help you decide if you wish to seek other forms of support or information. 

When you gambled, did you go back another day to try to win back the 
money you lost? 

Have you borrowed money or sold anything to get money to gamble? 

Have you felt that you might have a problem with gambling? 

Has gambling caused you any health problems, including stress or anxiety? 

Still thinking about the last 12 months, have you needed to gamble with 
larger amounts of money to get the same feeling of excitement?

Have people criticized your betting or told you that you had a gambling 
problem, regardless of whether or not you thought it was true? 

Has your gambling caused any financial problems for you or your household? 

Have you felt guilty about the way you gamble or what happens when you gamble? 

Total your score. The higher your score, the greater the risk that your gambling is a problem.

Score of 0: Non-problem gambling.
Score of 1 or 2:  Low level of problems with few or no identified negative consequences.
Score of 3 to 7:  Moderate level of problems leading to some negative consequences.
Score of 8 or more: Problem gambling with negative consequences and a possible loss of 
           control.
