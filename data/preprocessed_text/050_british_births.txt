conmoenmat BRITISH BIRTHS No 19416

A Survey under the joint auspices of the National Birthday Trust Fund and the
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

Please complete the enquiry for all babies born (alive or dead) after the 24th week of gestation from 00.01 hours
on Sunday 5th April, 1970 to 24.00 hours on Saturday 11th April, 1970 whether born in hosnital, at home or else-
where.

Part | relates to information not usually included in the clinical records. It will be necessary to interview the mother
as soon as possible after the birth.

Part Il is concerned with antenatal care and with the delivery. Complete soon after birth using all the available
records, discussing with the doctor or anyone else concerned with the care of the mother and baby.

Part If relates to the first seven days after the birth. Keep it up-to-date daily, if possible, so that it is immediately
available if the mother moves. If the mother and baby are separated, complete the form for the mother first and then
forward it for the baby section to be completed.

Most questions are pre-coded and except where otherwise stated should be answered by ringing one or more
numbers as appropriate. Please complete one section at least in each question. Do not leave a question blank.
For Multiple Births, please complete the whole form for the first baby. For each of the other babies, question 1
of Part | should be filled in and then question 25 of Part I] onwards, on a separate form.

When the form is complete it should normally be returned to the supervisor of midwives, the superintendent midwife,
or the matron of the hospital unless other arrangements have been made locally.
