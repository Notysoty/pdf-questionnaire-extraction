Development and Validation of the Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS)

This article describes the development and validation of a measure of the stress experienced
by African Americans as a result of their daily encounters with racism and discrimination.
The Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS) is a 46-item instrument developed according to the
theoretical framework of daily hassles (R. S. Lazarus & S. Folkman, 1984) and integrated
with P. Essed's (1990) concept of everyday racism. The IRRS has adequate indexes of
internal consistency and fair-to-adequate estimates of test-retest stability. Several subscales
of the IRRS and a global racism index were correlated with other measures of stress and
racism. Furthermore, the IRRS discriminated between Blacks and non-Blacks in a group-
differences study. Both principal-components and confirmatory factor analyses supported a
4-component model of race-related stress.

Racism and acts of discrimination against African Amer-
icans have taken on various forms over the past 350 years,
ranging from lynchings, burnings, beatings, and other forms
of direct violence to more subtle slights and innuendoes
(Duckitt, 1992; Ponterotto & Pederson, 1993; Thompson,
Neville, Weathers, Poston, & Atkinson, 1990). There have
been several scholarly works of historical significance ex-
amining the nature of racism and discrimination in relation
to the experiences of African Americans in the United
States (e.g., Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Duc-
kitt, 1992; Essed, 1990; Myrdal, 1944; Jones, 1972; Petti-
grew, 1964; Simpson & Yinger, 1985). For the most part,
racism has been of interest primarily to social psychologists
who study the development and expression of prejudice and
in-group/out-group attitudes, or sociologists who are pri-
marily concerned with the outcome effects of racism and
discrimination on groups of people within society. How-
ever, psychologists have more recently begun to examine
the clinical significance of racism and its relationship to the
psychological well-being of African Americans who expe-
rience it as a chronic stressor in their daily lives (see Burke,
1984; Fernando, 1984; Jackson, Williams, & Torres, 1995;
McNeilly et al., in press; Smith, 1985; White & Parham,
1990).

Despite some perceived progress made in U.S. race rela-
tions over the last three decades, many writers believe that
for African Americans, racism continues to be an inescap-
able and painful reality of daily life (Essed, 1990; Feagin &

Sikes, 1994; McNeilly et al., in press). Essed (1990), in her
groundbreaking qualitative study of the daily experiences of
Blacks with racism, described the chronic nature of the
stress associated with racism this way: "to live with the
threat of racism means planning, almost everyday of one's
life, how to avoid or defend oneself against discrimination"
(p. 260). The experience of racism for African Americans is
cumulative, whereby new encounters are interpreted on the
basis of past experiences with racism, knowledge of others'
experience with racism, and knowledge about the systemic
nature of racism (Essed, 1990; Feagin & Sikes, 1994).

According to Dovidio and Gaetner (1986) racism is em-
bedded in the "social norms, institutional policies, and cog-
nitive and affective systems of White Americans" (p. xi)
and as a result has a significant adverse impact on the
quality of life for African Americans. Racism can occur in
three spheres: (a) individual racism, experienced on a per-
sonal level; (b) institutional racism, experienced as a result
of racism being embedded in the policies of a given insti-
tution; and (c) cultural racism, results from the cultural
practices of one group being lauded as superior to those of
another (Essed, 1990; Jones, 1972). Essed (1990) extended
the individual realm of racism to include collective racism.
Collective racism occurs when organized (or semiorga-
nized) Whites/non-Blacks seek to restrict the rights of
Blacks (e.g., when a Black family moves into a White
community and is met with open hostility by its new neigh-
bors). Because of the omnipresence of racism, it makes
intuitive sense that any effort to study its impact on African
Americans would focus on the multidimensional character
of its expression and experience.

Due to the insidiousness of everyday racism, empirical
examination of this construct can be an arduous task. Con-
sequently, past research has generally focused on examining
the most overt acts of racism experienced by African Amer-
icans. However, the racism experienced by African Amer-
icans throughout the day—whether at work, in public
places, in route to and from their homes, or on television
and other popular media outlets—for the most part has
remained unexamined (Essed, 1990). The greatest challenge

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 491

faced by researchers who wish to measure the stressful
effects of everyday racism is to first identify it. The diffi-
culty of this task is exacerbated by the fact that everyday
racism is often covert and can be subtle, elusive, or seem-
ingly intangible to those who experience it in their daily
lives (Dovidio, 1993; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986; Essed,
1990).

The stress associated with the experience of discrimina-
tion has been implicated in the development of psychiatric
disorders such as depression (Burke, 1984), antisocial be-
havior (Simpson & Yinger, 1985), lowered self-esteem
(Fernando, 1984), lowered levels of general happiness and
life satisfaction (Jackson et al., 1995), and poor academic
performance (Gougis, 1986). The deleterious effect on the
psychological health of African Americans that may result
from everyday racism is significant and should be addressed
by counseling psychologists and other mental health prac-
titioners. When providing psychological services to African
American clients, counselors can include an assessment,
possibly during the intake process, of the extent to which
racism and discrimination might be related to the client's
presenting problem or problems, or in some way interfering
with the client's current level of functioning (Smith, 1985).
Consequently, there is a strong need for a self-administered,
psychometrically sound (and relatively brief) measure of the
magnitude and range of an individual's experiences with
racism and discrimination (Outlaw, 1993).

Previous attempts to quantitatively examine the experi-
ences of African Americans with racism have resulted in the
development of several paper-and-pencil self-report instru-
ments, none of which have been published in the major
psychological journals. These efforts have been aimed at
examining the cognitive processes, emotional responses,
and the behavioral reactions associated with the experience
of racism and discrimination as reported by African Amer-
icans. The measures of racism currently available include
the Racial Discrimination Index (RDI; Terrell & Miller,
1980), the Racism Reaction Scale (RRS; Thompson et al.,
1990), the Perceived Racism Scale (PRS; McNeilly et al., in
press), and the Racism and Life Experience Scales—Brief
Version (RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994). In spite of several the-
oretical and methodological limitations, these attempts to
quantify the experiences of African Americans with racism
and discrimination have made a substantial contribution to
the empirical examination of the stressful effects of racism.

A psychometrically sound self-report instrument that
measures the stress associated with daily encounters of
racism and discrimination experienced by African Ameri-
cans is needed. Such an instrument, if used in a clinical
setting, would allow for the effective and efficient assess-
ment of the experience of race-related stress and its impact
on the psychological functioning of an individual. Having a
valid and reliable self-report measure available to determine
the extent to which racism adversely affects an individual's
psychological well-being would aid in the diagnosis and
treatment of some psychological and somatic stress-related
disorders prevalent in the African American community.
Furthermore, a measure of race-related stress would have
implications as a research tool, which would effectively

allow for an examination of the relationship between racism
and some of the stress-induced psychological and somatic
health problems of African Americans. Other possibilities
for research inquiry include the relationship between the
stressful experience of racism and discrimination and racial-
identity development among African Americans. One could
also examine the relationship between the stressful effects
of racism and the impact of the counselor's willingness to
address these issues on counseling outcomes for African
Americans.

The Index of Race-Related Stress (IRRS) is intended to
provide a much needed measure of the stress associated
with the experiences of racism and discrimination encoun-
tered by African Americans in their daily lives. The theo-
retical framework of the IRRS is grounded in the daily
hassles conceptualization of life stress proposed by Lazarus
and Folkman (1984) and integrated with Essed's (1990)
concept of everyday racism. The IRRS samples the occur-
rence and perceived magnitude of stressful race-related
events occurring daily in the lives of African Americans.
The ERRS also takes into account the stressful effects of
network events, which are stressful events that happen to
family members and people one cares about (Feagin &
Sikes, 1994; Thoits, 1991). According to Lazarus and Folk-
man (1984), "it is perfectly appropriate to measure stress as
either input, response, or strained relationship" (p. 307).
Furthermore, they posit that stress can be envisioned as a
general concept much like emotion, motivation, or cogni-
tion, but operationalized according to the perceived magni-
tude of the interactions with the environment that tax or
exceed the person's resources. Accordingly, the IRRS mea-
sures race-related stress operationalized as the occurrence
and perceived magnitude of specific events of racism and
discrimination that African Americans potentially experi-
ence in their daily lives.

In the development of the IRRS as a measure of race-
related stress, the researchers sought to answer several sig-
nificant and related questions. First, is the experience of
racism that African Americans encounter in their daily lives
a multidimensional phenomenon that occurs across domains
(i.e., institutionally, culturally, etc.)? Second, would the
IRRS correlate with other measures of stress and racism,
thereby proving itself to be a valid measure of race-related
stress within its own right? Furthermore, could the IRRS be
proven as a reliable measure of race-related stress on the
basis of indexes of internal consistency and stability over
time? Finally, because the IRRS is intended to measure the
stress associated with everyday racism as uniquely experi-
enced by African Americans, would it effectively discrim-
inate between Blacks and non-Blacks?

On the basis of a review of the literature (Essed, 1990;
Feagin & Sikes, 1994; Jones, 1972), an examination of
existing measures of racism (RDI; Terrell & Miller, 1980;
RRS; Thompson et al., 1990; PRS; McNeilly et al., in press;
RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994), and a pilot study, we anticipated
that the IRRS would sample the multidimensionality of
racism. More specifically, on the basis of the pilot study and
the model of racism posited by Jones (1972) and later
expanded on by Essed (1990), we hypothesized that the

principal-component structure of the IRRS would produce a
three- or four-component model. Using one of the racism
measures currently in existence (RaLES-B; Harrell, 1994;
see Instruments), the researchers also hypothesized that the
IRRS and the RaLES-B would be positively correlated on
measures representing comparable domains of racism (i.e.,
RaLES-B Group and the IRRS' measure of cultural racism)
as well as their global measures of racism. It was also
hypothesized that the IRRS subscales and global measure
would be positively correlated with another measure of
stress (PSS; Cohen, Karmarck, & Mermelstein, 1983; see
Instruments). Finally, the researchers hypothesized that the
IRRS would discriminate between Blacks and non-Blacks,
with Blacks having higher indicators of race-related stress.

General Method

Item Development

The development of the initial items included on the IRRS was
based on informal interviews with African Americans from diverse
backgrounds (both men and women), a review of the literature, and
the personal life experiences of the primary researcher (a male
African American). Efforts were made to ensure that the items
could be easily understood by someone reading at the eighth-grade
level or higher. The researchers reviewed all potential items for
redundancy, and those found to be repetitious were eliminated
from the scale. On the basis of these procedures, a total of 74 items
were generated and placed on a 5-point Likert-type scale. If an
individual was the victim of a racist or discriminatory act, they
were to indicate their reaction to the event on the basis of the
following response choices: 1 = no reaction, 2 = irritation, 3 =
anger, 4 = hostility, 5 = rage. Individuals were to respond only to
those events that they experienced, leaving the ones they did not
experience blank.

Content Validity

To aid in assessing the content validity of the IRRS, a focus
group composed of 5 African Americans was facilitated by the
primary researcher for approximately 2

x
h hr. In addition to eval-

uating the content validity of the IRRS, it was examined for its
efficiency of administration and any potential harmful effects that
might result from its completion. The group members completed
the IRRS and a discussion concerning its structure, item clarity,
item domain appropriateness, and the comprehensiveness of the
scale ensued.

As a result of the focus group, concerns were raised that resulted
in several changes being made to the IRRS. First, the original
5-point Likert-type scale (1 = no reaction; 2 = irritation; 3 =
anger; 4 = hostility; and 5 = rage), on which group members
found it difficult to differentiate between several of the response
choices (i.e., anger, hostility, and rage), was changed (1 = unaf-
fected by the event; 2 = slightly bothered by the event; 3 = event
was upsetting; and 4 = extremely upset by event) to allow respon-
dents to more clearly distinguish between their reactions. Second,
some of the events were ambiguous and needed clarification.
Third, the group pointed out that several significant events fitting
the criteria for inclusion were omitted (i.e., events relating to the
race-sex dynamic).

In addition to the focus group, five individuals (who were not
part of the focus group) with extensive research backgrounds on

racial-ethnic, gender, and cultural issues examined the IRRS items
for their clarity and domain appropriateness. Each expert judge,
who was a published scholar in the topical area, rated the items on
the IRRS using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = confusing; 2 =
ambiguous; 3 = fairly clear; and 4 = very clear) to indicate the
item's clarity. The domain appropriateness of each item was rated
as yes or no. Those items receiving a mean rating of less than 3.0
on item clarity were either rewritten or eliminated. Items rated as
not being domain appropriate were likewise rewritten or elimi-
nated. The net result was an initial IRRS version consisting of 67
items with a total score range of 1 to 268, with higher scores
indicating a greater severity of race-related stress.

Pilot Study

Following the item development and content validity studies of
the IRRS, a pilot study was conducted with 377 participants from
various geographic locations throughout the United States. The
sample consisted of 203 women and 163 men (11 missing gender
variables) with ages ranging from 17 to 57, with a mean age of
22.65 years (SD = 6.85). One purpose of the pilot study was to
determine the logistics of the IRRS's administration, such as the
time it takes to complete, the readability and clarity of the items,
the clarity of the IRRS instructions, and the content validity of the
IRRS items, with a sample of participants similar in demographic
background to the target population. Another purpose of the pilot
study was to conduct a preliminary examination of the IRRS's
factor structure for an informal comparison to Jones's (1972)
three-tier model of racism and Essed's (1990) four-tier model.

Based on the results of the pilot study, several changes were
made to the IRRS. Foremost, it was discovered that during the
pilot study many of the questionnaires were incorrectly completed.
The researchers suspected that requiring participants to check
some items, while leaving others blank, was confusing. As a result,
a new Likert-type scale on which no items are left blank was
designed (0 = This has never happened to me; 1 = This event
happened, but did not bother me; 2 = This event happened and I
was slightly upset; 3 = This event happened and I was upset; 4 =
This event happened and I was extremely upset). This response
rating scale is consistent with those used on other stress-related
measures (i.e., Daily Hassles Scale; Kanner, Coyne, Schafer, &
Lazarus, 1980; Perceived Stress Scale, Cohen et al., 1983; Ways of
Coping Scale, Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).

Using only those surveys that were completed correctly, a
principal-components analysis was performed on all 67 items of
the IRRS. This procedure yielded 17 factors with eigenvalues of
greater than 1.0. However, a scree test (Cattell, 1965) indicated
that as many as four factors were interpretable. Consequently, the
researchers forced a one-, two-, three-, and four-component ex-
traction using both an orthogonal and oblique solution. The most
interpretable of the four extractions, and consistent with the liter-
ature on the multidimensionality of racism (i.e., Essed, 1990;
Jones, 1972), was the three-component orthogonal solution. Com-
ponent 1 (eigenvalue = 13.6), with 25 items, accounted for 20% of
the common variance; Component 2 (eigenvalue = 3.4), with 20
items, accounted for 5.1% of the common variance; and Compo-
nent 3 (eigenvalue = 3.0), with 15 items, accounted for 4.6% of
the common variance. The criteria for retaining items were as
follows: (a) items with component loadings of .35 or higher were
selected; (b) items meeting the .35 criteria on more than one
component were eliminated.

From the results of the principal-components analysis, a total of
eight items were eliminated on the basis of the selection criteria.
An additional item was dropped on the basis of the researchers'

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 493

judgment. Thus, the current version of the IRRS comprised 59
items in total.

Study 1

The purpose of Study 1 was to determine the principal-
component structure of the revised IRRS by conducting a
second principal-components analysis. In addition to deter-
mining the component structure of the IRRS, indexes of
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) were computed for
each of the components extracted during this study. Fur-
thermore, Pearson's product-moment correlation coeffi-
cients were calculated to determine the relationship between
the IRRS subscales.

The IRRS is intended for use with individuals identifying
themselves as African American. As the IRRS is intended
for use with African American adults in general, the re-
searchers attempted to sample a heterogeneous population
for Study 1. Only those individuals over the age of 17 were
included in this study, as the scale is designed to measure
race-related stress in African American adults. Moreover,
various geographic regions, educational levels, and socio-
economic levels are represented in the sample.

Method

Sample. The total sample for Study 1 included 302 participants
from Greensboro, NC, and New York City. In an effort to obtain
a sample demographically similar to the target population, partic-
ipants were selected from a variety of settings: colleges and
universities, a substance abuse treatment facility, and the commu-
nity at large. It is significant to note that there were no incorrectly
completed surveys in this study. There were approximately 10
surveys that were incomplete or suspected of being invalid. A total
of 7 individuals refused to participate, primarily non-Blacks who
found the material offensive. Participants in Study 1 did not take
part in the pilot study.

Of the 302 participants in Study 1, 167 (55%) were female and
115 (38%) were male (19 missing values). Their ages ranged from
18 to 61 years, with a mean age of 26.77 (SD = 9.02). The sample
included 90% American-born Blacks (8% represent Caribbean-
born Blacks; 2% = missing values). Geographically, the sample
included 188 participants from the New York City region and 113
from North Carolina (1 missing value). Of the entire sample, 35%
were from the community at large, 51 % were college students, and
13% were residents in a substance abuse treatment facility. The
marital status of the sample included 76% single, 13% married, 5%
separated, and 1% widowed. For the entire sample, 29% were
employed, with 17% earning between $10,000 and $25,000 annu-
ally, and 28% earning below $10,000. Only 10% of those em-
ployed earned more than $25,000 annually. The sample's mean
years of education was 13.79.

Procedure. In cases in which the IRRS was sent away for data
collection, it was administered by doctoral-level proctors who had
been thoroughly briefed in the proper protocol for its administra-
tion. In all other cases, the primary researcher was responsible for
administration of the questionnaires. The survey was completed
anonymously, and participation was on a voluntary basis. Each
survey included a cover letter and demographic questionnaire. In

the cover letter a statement was issued to the effect that by
completing the questionnaire, informed consent could be assumed.
The survey generally took 20 to 30 min to complete, dependent on
the average reading ability of the group.

The recruitment of participants was aided by a lottery held as an
incentive for participation in the study. Individuals who agreed to
participate were given a lottery number, and a drawing was held at
the conclusion of each data collection session. The winner received
a $25 cash prize. The participants were debriefed individually or in
groups following the collection of data.

Results

IRRS component structure. A principal-components
analysis was again performed on all items of the IRRS. This
time the procedure yielded 15 components with eigenvalues
of greater than 1.0. Once more, a scree test (Cattell, 1965)
indicated that as many as four components were interpret-
able. As a result, one-, two-, three-, and four-component
extractions were forced using both an oblique and orthog-
onal rotation method. For this study the most interpretable
of the four extractions, and the one conceptually supported
by the literature (see Essed's, 1990, Collective Racism as an
extension of the three-tier model proposed by Jones, 1972),
was the four-component orthogonal solution.

The four-component orthogonal solution accounted for
38% of the common variance, as did the oblique solution,
but the orthogonal solution loaded items to components that
were consistently more logical than the oblique. The criteria
for retaining items to the scale were as follows: (a) items
were required to have a component loading of .40 or higher
to be selected, and (b) items meeting the .40 criteria must
also have been at least .15 greater than all other items
loading on the same component. See Table 1 for IRRS
items, component loadings, communalities, and item means
and standard deviations.

Component 1 (eigenvalue = 13.36) was responsible for
23% of the common variance, with 16 items loading on this
component. These items represent the experience of racism
on a cultural level. Component 2 (eigenvalue = 4.58) was
responsible for 8% of the common variance, with 11 items
meeting the selection criteria. For the most part these items
represent the experience of racism on an institutional level.
Component 3 (eigenvalue = 2.45) accounted for 4% of the
common variance, with 11 items meeting the criteria for
selection. The general theme of these items relates to the
experience of racism on an individual level. Component 4
(eigenvalue = 2.06) accounted for 3% of the common
variance, with 8 items meeting the criteria for selection. The
concept of collective racism, an extension of individual
racism (Essed, 1990), accounts for the general theme of this
component.

Internal consistency and subscale inter correlations.
The coefficient alphas for the new IRRS subscales were .87
for Component 1, Cultural Racism; .85 for Component 2,
Institutional Racism; .84 for Component 3, Individual Rac-
ism; and .79 for Component 4, Collective Racism.

Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were
calculated to determine the subscale intercorrelations of the

2. You notice that crimes committed by White people tend to be
romanticized, whereas the same crime committed by a Black person is
portrayed as savagery, and the Black person who committed it, as an
animal. .65

3. You notice that when a Black person is killed by a White mob or
policeman no one is sent to jail. .59

8. You notice that when Black people are killed by the police, the media
informs the public of the victim's criminal record or negative
information in their background, suggesting they got what they
deserved.

13. You have observed that White kids who commit violent crimes are
portrayed as "boys being boys," while Black kids who commit similar
crimes are wild animals. .63

systems of government (court, media, disciplinary committees, etc.)
work (or don't work) when dealing with Blacks as opposed to Whites/
non-Blacks. .57

IRRS. Cultural Racism correlated .42 with Institutional
Racism, .56 with Individual Racism, and .30 with Collective
Racism, ps < .01. Institutional Racism correlated .57 with
Individual Racism and .58 with Collective Racism, ps <

ism, p < .01. On the basis of these low-to-moderate inter-
correlations, the IRRS subscales are best conceptualized as
related yet distinct measures of the stress experienced by
African Americans in their encounters with racism and
discrimination.

496 UTSEY AND PONTEROTTO

Study 2

A second study was conducted to examine other forms of
construct validity for the IRRS. First of all, a confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) of the IRRS component structure was
conducted. A CFA is an effective and powerful method for
investigating the construct validity of a measure (Rahim &
Magner, 1995). Also, in an effort to establish the concurrent
validity of the Index of Race-Related Stress, we adminis-
tered simultaneously a second measure of the perceived
stressful magnitude of racism and discrimination
(RaLES-B) as well as a second measure of perceived stress
(Perceived Stress Scale). Furthermore, we used the group-
differences method (see Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) for es-
tablishing construct validity by comparing IRRS subscale
scores for Blacks with the scores of a subsample of non-
Blacks (Whites and Asians; n = 31). Moreover, indexes of
internal consistency for the IRRS subscales were again
calculated.

Method

Sample. The total sample size for Study 2 was 341 participants,
including a subsample of 31 non-Blacks used for the group-
comparison validity procedure. The non-Black subsample was not
included in any data analysis other than the group-comparison
procedure. In this study, as with the previous one, participants
were selected from colleges, universities, and the community at
large. Again, there is representation of African Americans from a
wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, geographic regions,
and educational levels.

For Blacks exclusively, the total sample size in Study 2 was 310.
Of this number, 207 (67%) were female and 92 (30%) were male.
Their ages ranged from 17 to 76 years, with a mean age of 23.38
(SD = 7.74). This sample included 87% American-born Blacks
(12% represent Caribbean-born Blacks; missing values = 4). Geo-
graphically, the sample for Study 2 included 153 participants from
Washington, DC, and 157 from New York City. Of the entire
sample, 16% were from the community at large and the remainder
were college students representing various colleges and universi-
ties in the Northeast. The marital status of the sample was 85%
single, 9% married, 3% separated, 2% divorced, and 6% widowed.
For participants in the community sample, 6.7% were employed.
Of this group the annual income was $10,000 or less for the
majority of participants. The mean years of education for the
community-at-large sample was 12.39.

In the non-Black subsample (n = 31), there were 23 Whites and
8 Asians. The non-Black subsample had an age range of 19 to 47
years, with a mean of 27.97 (SD = 7.64). There were 16 women
(55%) and 15 men (45%). The mean for years of education in the
non-Black subsample was 13.74 (SD = 3.97). The marital status of
the subsample was 78% single, 16% married, and 6% divorced.
The majority of participants in the non-Black subsample also had
an annual income level below $10,000.

Instruments. The RaLES-B is a self-report measure that sam-
ples the minority group members' perceptions of the impact of
racism on their lives. Part I of the scale produces a Perceived
Racism—Self total score and consists of 20 items, with a range
from 0-80. Part II produces a Perceived Racism—Group total
score and consists of 12 items, with a range from 0-48. The
RaLES, in a study on the adaptive functioning of African Amer-
ican adolescents (Wells, 1995), was reported to have a Cronbach's

alpha of .88 for the Racism—Self subscale and .90 for the
Racism—Group subscale. In addition, Racism—Self was signifi-
cantly correlated with the Immersion dimension of racial identity
(r = .26, p < .01) and with adaptive functioning (r = .18, p <
.05). Racism—Group was significantly correlated with both the
Encounter (r = .23, p < .01) and Internalization (r = .29, p < .01)
dimensions of racial identity development. In the current study the
RaLES-B Self and Group subscales had Cronbach alphas of .90
and .83, respectively (n = 55).

The Perceived Stress Scale is a 14 item Likert-type (item re-
sponse scale = 0-4) self-report measure of the degree to which
one views situations in his or her life as stressful. The PSS was
designed to assess the degree to which people find events in their
lives to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading. PSS
scores are calculated by first reversing the scores on 7 positive
items and then summing across all 14 items. In one study (Cohen
et al., 1983), the PSS was found to correlate positively and sig-
nificantly with Life Events Scores among two separate college
samples (.20 to .35, p < .01). Cohen et al. (1983) reported
Cronbach alphas of .84 and .85 for the two college samples and .86
for a smoking cessation sample. The PSS had a 2-day test-retest
correlation of .85 and a .55 correlation after 6 weeks. In the current
study, the PSS had a Cronbach's alpha of .70 (n = 51).

Procedure. A new sample of participants was recruited for
Study 2, of which most were participating on a volunteer basis, the
exception being one group of college students (n = 153), who
received extra class credit for participation. In administering the
IRRS, the same procedures as followed in the previous studies
were repeated. Participants were again debriefed individually or in
groups following the questionnaire's administration. All partici-
pants except those in the non-Black subsample were given the
same instructions for completing the IRRS. The non-Black sub-
sample was instructed to replace "Black" with their own racial
group identity; for example, instead of reading the item "you were
treated with less respect because you are Black," it would be "you
were treated with less respect because you are White (or Asian)."

As previously noted, two additional instruments were adminis-
tered simultaneously with the IRRS to two separate subsamples for
the purpose of establishing the scale's concurrent validity. The first
subsample (n = 51) received the PSS, randomly distributed over
the entire sample of Study 2. The second subsample (n = 57)
received the RaLES-B. These were also randomly distributed over
the entire sample. For the RaLES-B, the sequence in which the
surveys were administered was alternated to control for instrumen-
tation effects. However, the PSS was always placed before the
IRRS in its order in the survey package to prevent the participants
from being influenced in their responses to the PSS by the nature
of the IRRS items.

Results

Confirmatory factor analysis. A confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 46 items of the IRRS,
using the LISREL 7 computer program (Joreskog & Sor-
bom, 1989). Comparisons were made between the identified
four-component orthogonal model, a four-component
oblique model, a global component model, and a null
model. Several indexes assessing the degree to which the
model fits the data were computed by the researchers for all
four competing models. First, a chi-square statistic was
computed for each of the models, including the null. It is
important to note that the chi-square statistic tends to be
affected by large sample sizes and will likely produce a

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 497

significant result in spite of a reasonable fit to the data
(Bentler & Bonett, 1980). In addition, significant chi-
squares will occur with models that have numerous vari-
ables and high degrees of freedom (Bryant & Yarnold,
1995).

By referring to Table 2 for a complete summary of the
results of the confirmatory factor analysis, it will be ob-
served that the chi-square statistic for all four competing
models was significant, suggesting an unsatisfactory fit.
Additionally, as indicated by all indexes used in this study
to evaluate the fit of the competing models, the four-
component oblique model had the greatest degree of fit
across all measures. The four-component oblique model
was the best fit because it had the lowest x2 value
(1,865.24), the highest goodness-of-fit index (GFI; .78) and
adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI; .76), the lowest -^Idf
value (1.89), the lowest root mean square residual (RMSR;
.080), and the highest relative noncentrality index (RNI;
.80). The RNI is also independent of sample size, and
according to Gerbing and Anderson (1993), the best avail-
able measure for determining the fit of structural equation
models.

Looking closely at these values, we would evaluate the
general fit of the proposed model as unsatisfactory. More
desirable fits have, for example, the GFI in the high .80s and
.90s. According to Bagozzi and Heatherton (1994), it is
common for measurement models to have an unsatisfactory
fit when more than four or five items represent each com-
ponent and the sample size is large. The poor fit in these
cases is likely to be related to several factors: (a) the
complexity of the models, (b) high levels of random error to
be found in a scale with many items, and (c) the many
parameters to be estimated. One method that has been
recommended (see Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994; Rahim &
Magner, 1995) to address this problem is to sum items
within each component, thus creating aggregate variables
that represent parallel indicators of the construct being
measured by the items. Items with the highest component
loadings are paired with items having the lowest component
loading in sequential order in which the first, second, and
third highest loadings are paired with their corresponding
lowest loadings, whereas the remaining items are randomly
distributed among the new indicator variables (see Mathieu,
1991). After the items have been aggregated to form new
and fewer indicators of the same construct, they are reen-

tered into the LISREL 7 program and subjected to a second
confirmatory factor analysis.

Using the method recommended by Bagozzi and Heath-
erton (1994) and Rahim and Magner (1995), the authors
created the following aggregate variables to be reanalyzed
using the LISREL 7 program: Cultural Racism 1 (Items 2,
15, 31, & 3); Cultural Racism 2 (Items 40, 44, 43, & 34);
Cultural Racism 3 (Items 8, 29, 21, & 35); Cultural Racism
4 (Items 13, 42, 23, & 37); Institutional Racism 1 (Items 18
& 46); Institutional Racism 2 (Items 12, 26, & 19); Insti-
tutional Racism 3 (Items 20,45, & 39); Institutional Racism
4 (Items 32,41, & 38); Individual Racism 1 (Items 9 & 33);
Individual Racism 2 (Items 22, 30, & 4); Individual Racism
3 (Items 5, 17, & 27); Individual Racism 4 (Items 1, 24, &
6); Collective Racism 1 (Items 14 & 16); Collective Racism
2 (Items 10 & 36); Collective Racism 3 (Items 7 & 25);
Collective Racism 4 (Items 11 & 28). Because these aggre-
gated variables represent new items of the same compo-
nents, Cronbach's alphas were again calculated. For Cul-
tural Racism, Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and
Collective Racism, the Cronbach alpha was .86, .77, .83,
and .75, respectively.

On review of the second confirmatory factor analysis
results found in Table 3, it will be observed that the fit
indexes for the four-component 16 aggregate variables im-
proved. The GFIs and AGFIs for both the orthogonal and
oblique models ranged from .78 to .90 and .71 to .86,
respectively. The RNIs for the orthogonal and oblique mod-
els ranged from .74 to .92, respectively. Although a better fit
for the proposed model (orthogonal) would have been de-
sirable, the primary objective of this study was to find the
best fit for the data among the competing models. Accord-
ing to Bryant and Yarnold (1995), the most common use of
a confirmatory factor analysis is to determine "whether a
particular factor model fits the data better than others" (p.
119). Consequently, and in contradiction to the hypothe-
sized model (four-component orthogonal model), the four-
component oblique model demonstrated the best overall fit
among the competing component models in this study (see
Table 3). That the four-component oblique model is the best
fit is not surprising given the moderate correlations found
between some subscales of the IRRS.

Internal consistency and intercorrelations of IRRS sub-
scales. Consistent with Study 1, the internal consistency of
the IRRS subscales was determined to be sufficiently ade-

bach's alpha of .89. Component 2, Institutional Racism,
obtained a Cronbach's alpha of .82. Component 3, Individ-
ual Racism, obtained a Cronbach's alpha of .84. For Com-
ponent 4, Collective Racism, Cronbach's alpha was .74.

Also consistent with Study 1, the IRRS subscale intercor-
relations were as follows: Cultural Racism correlated .37
with Institutional Racism, .53 with Individual Racism, and
.22 with Collective Racism, ps < .01. Institutional Racism
correlated .56 with Individual Racism and .66 with Collec-
tive Racism, ps < .01. Individual Racism correlated .51
with Collective Racism,/? < .01. Subscale intercorrelations
remain low to moderate, again suggesting that the IRRS is
measuring related yet distinct aspects of race-related stress.

Concurrent validity. To establish the concurrent validity
of the IRRS, Pearson product-moment correlation coeffi-
cients were computed between its four subscales, the
RaLES-B Self and Group subscales, and the PSS. In addi-
tion, an IRRS Global Racism score was calculated by con-
verting each subscale total score to a z score, thereby
weighting equally the contribution that each racism domain
contributes to the Global score. The IRRS Global Racism
score was then correlated with a global racism score for the
RaLES-B (Self and Group subscale score combined) and
the PSS.

The results of the Pearson product-moment correlation
procedure between the IRRS subscales, including the
Global Racism measure, and the RaLES-B are presented in
Table 4. A positive and significant correlation was found to
exist between Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, Indi-

vidual Racism, and the Group subscale of the RaLES-B.
Collective Racism did not significantly correlate with the
RaLES-B Group subscale. For the Self subscale of the
RaLES-B, there was a positive and significant correlation
with the Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Col-
lective Racism subscales of the IRRS. The RaLES-B Self
subscale did not significantly correlate with the IRRS Cul-
tural Racism subscale. The IRRS Global Racism measure
was positively and significantly correlated with the
RaLES-B Global Racism measure.

To establish further evidence of the concurrent validity of
the IRRS' subscales and its Global Racism measure, a
second measure of stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et
al., 1983) was administered simultaneously. Consequently,
Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were
calculated on these variables. It can be observed, by refer-
ring to Table 4, that a positive and significant correlation
exists between Cultural Racism, Individual Racism, and the
PSS. Institutional Racism and Collective Racism were not
significantly correlated with the PSS. However, a positive
and significant correlation was found to exist between the
IRRS's Global Racism measure and the PSS.

Group differences. On the expectation that Blacks
would score significantly higher than non-Blacks on the
IRRS subscales, a multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA) comparing these two subsamples was per-
formed. Whites and Asians were combined for this analysis
on the basis of a MANOVA finding of no significant
difference between the groups' IRRS subscale scores, Ho-
tellings T

2
 = F(4, 27) = 1.21, p = .32. The MANOVA

comparing Blacks with non-Blacks (Whites and Asians)
produced a significant result, Hotellings T

2
 = .322, F(4,

336) = 27.04, p = .00. The Bonferroni formula was used to
control for the inflated alpha due to four follow-up univar-
iate ANOVAs. Alpha was set at .012. Subsequent univariate
F test and mean examination indicated that Blacks scored
significantly higher than non-Blacks on Cultural Racism,
F(l, 339) = 55.89, p < .00 (Blacks' M = 44.50, SD =
13.03; non-Blacks' M = 18.38, SD = 17.75); Institutional
Racism, F(l, 339) = 10.37, p < .00 (Blacks' M = 13.88,
SD = 9.88; non-Blacks' M = 6.22, SD = 5.63); Individual
Racism, F{\, 339) = 37.89, p < .00 (Blacks' M = 21.46,
SD = 10.39; non-Blacks' M = 10.12, SD = 6.93); and
Collective Racism, F(l, 339) = 15.27, p < .00 (Blacks'
M = 8.63, SD = 6.75; non-Blacks' M = 5.66, SD = 4.93).

INDEX OF RACE-RELATED STRESS 499

Study 3

To establish the stability of the ERRS over time, two
separate samples were recruited for a test-retest adminis-
tration. In addition to using two separate samples, we used
different test-retest intervals in the IRRS's administration.

Method

Sample. The first sample was recruited from introductory psy-
chology classes at an historically Black college in Greensboro, NC
(n = 31). Of the 31 in this sample, 9 were men and 21 were women
(1 missing). The mean age of this group was 20.48 (5D = 3.78).
The participants in the second sample (n = 19) were recruited
from an adult education program located in New York City. Of
these participants, 4 were men and 15 were women. The mean age
for this group was 29.42 (SD = 9.42).

Procedure. The general procedures followed during regular
administrations of the IRRS were followed during Study 3 for both
test-retest samples. The IRRS was administered to the first sample
of participants on a designated day and then again 3 weeks later.
Likewise, the second sample of participants was administered the
IRRS on a designated day and men again 2 weeks later. In both
cases participants were debriefed individually or in groups.

Results

In the first sample the test-retest reliability coefficients
for Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, Individual Rac-
ism, and Collective Racism were .77, .69, .61, and .79,
respectively. In the second sample, the test-retest reliability
coefficients for Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, In-
dividual Racism, and Collective Racism were .58, .71, .54,
and .75, respectively.

Discussion

The current research sought to develop and validate a
paper-and-pencil self-report instrument that measures the
stress associated with the experience of racism in the daily
lives of African Americans. The theoretical framework un-
derlying the development of this measure was based on an
integration of the daily-hassles concept of stress (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984) and the multidimensional conceptualization
of everyday racism posited by Essed (1990). The net result
of the preliminary phase of this study was a 46-item, self-
report instrument, intended for use with African American
adults from a wide range of demographic backgrounds.

A principal-components analysis and a confirmatory fac-
tor analysis supported a four-component structure as best
representing the experiences of racism in the daily lives of
African Americans. The four subscales of the IRRS repeat-
edly demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliabilities
over two separate studies. In addition, the subscale inter-
correlations were low to moderate across the two studies.
Moreover, the four subscales of the IRRS proved to be
consistent with Essed's (1990) conceptual model of every-
day racism; the following domains were represented by the

four-component structure: (a) cultural, (b) institutional, (c)
individual, (d) collective.

Initial evidence for the concurrent validity of the IRRS
subscales was established by using a second measure of
racism (RaLES-B) and a second measure of perceived
stress (PSS). Both the Self and Group subscales of
RaLES-B provided support for the concurrent validity of
the ERRS by positively and significantly correlating with
several of its subscales. The RaLES-B Group subscale, as
hypothesized, correlated positively and significantly with
the Cultural Racism, Institutional Racism, and Individual
Racism subscales of the ERRS. The RaLES-B Self subscale
was significantly correlated (in a positive direction) with the
Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Collective
Racism subscales of the ERRS. In addition, the IRRS Global
Racism measure was positively and significantly correlated
with the RaLES-B Global Racism measure. The fact that no
correlation was found between the RaLES-B Self subscale
and the Cultural Racism subscale of the IRRS is logical
given the divergent manifestations associated with these
two types of racism.

In a second correlational study, the PSS, as hypothesized,
correlated positively and significantly with the Cultural
Racism, Individual Racism, and a Global Racism measure
of the ERRS. The lack of a significant correlation between
the PSS and the other subscales of the IRRS might be
explained by several factors. For example, encounters with
institutional racism are likely to be less frequent than expo-
sure to cultural racism, and better concealed by the perpe-
trator or perpetrators than the direct encounters of individual
racism. The lack of a significant correlation of the Collec-
tive Racism measure and the PSS might be explained by the
extreme nature of these events and their low rate of inci-
dence among the current sample.

Using the group differences approach, the IRRS demon-
strated adequate criterion-related validity by discriminating
between Blacks and non-Blacks on its Cultural Racism,
Institutional Racism, Individual Racism, and Collective
Racism subscales. As hypothesized, the IRRS performed
well as an index of the unique experiences and the magni-
tude of such experiences that African Americans have with
racism. The fact that the IRRS subscales discriminate be-
tween Blacks and non-Blacks provides further evidence for
the construct validity of the instrument.

Based on the results of two separate studies, using two
distinct samples, the test-retest reliability of the IRRS sub-
scales ranged from fair to adequate. In the first sample,
which consisted primarily of college students from the
South, the ERRS subscales obtained indexes of stability over
a 3-week period ranging from .61 to .79. In the second
study, with participants from an adult education program,
the indexes of stability for the IRRS subscales over a
2-week period ranged from .54 to .75. Indexes of stability
are considered adequate when they are in the .70 range. For
the IRRS subscales, the college sample obtained indexes
much more consistent with this criterion (i.e., .77, .69, .61,
and .79). This might be accounted for in part by the fact that
the college sample is from a historically Black college,
where the likelihood of having had any new encounters with

discrimination during the test-retest interval is reduced. On
the other hand, the sample from the adult education program
were exposed to events, including racism and discrimina-
tion, that might normally be experienced by African Amer-
icans in their daily contact with Whites and other non-
Blacks.

A potential criticism of the IRRS relates to the absence of
a time frame in which the participants are requested to recall
the occurrence of an event relating to racism or discrimina-
tion, or both, that they have experienced. The question
arises in this circumstance as to how accurate one can
remember his or her reaction to an event that occurred
several months ago, or even several years in the past.
However, assessing the stressful impact of African Ameri-
cans' experiences with racism is best served by not restrict-
ing the period of time in which it occurred; for as Feagin
and Sikes (1994) suggested, the effects of such traumatic
experiences are long lasting. Another potential criticism of
the IRRS and an ongoing issue in the field of stress research
relates to the potential confound between the occurrence of
race-related events and the intensity of such experiences.
Because participants who have not experienced a given
event are requested to select a response of 0, and those who
have had a given experience must select a response between
1 and 4, it might be argued that the two responses are
measures of separate constructs and should be analyzed
separately. This is a debatable issue (J. E. Holm, personal
communication, April 22, 1996; R. S. Lazarus, personal
communication, April 30, 1996), and it continues to be
deliberated between the major camps (i.e., daily hassles and
stressful life events proponents) of stress researchers and
can by no means be solved within the limits of this study.
For all practical purposes, and consistent with the work of
Lazarus and his colleagues (on which this study is in part
based), not having experienced an event results in a stress
score of 0 and is viewed within the realm of a scoring
continuum of 0 to 4 (see Daily Hassles Scale [Revised] by
Holm & Holroyd, 1992; Ways of Coping Scale by Lazarus
& Folkman, 1984).

The current findings suggest that the IRRS is a reliable
and valid measure of the multidimensional aspects of race-
related stress that African Americans potentially experience
in their daily lives. The IRRS can be used in assessing the
impact of racism and discrimination on the psychological
well-being of African American clients. Those providing
counseling services to this population can use the IRRS in
determining the need to address issues related to the client's
experience with racism and discrimination. In addition, the
IRRS can be further studied for possible adaptation as a
semistructured clinical interview protocol that can be used
qualitatively by counseling psychologists in serving an Af-
rican American population. The research utility of the IRRS
is limitless and includes such topical areas as examining the
therapy outcomes for African American clients, the impact
of racism on the racial identity development of African
Americans, racism and its relation to the life satisfaction of
African Americans, and the impact of racism on vocational
choices and academic outcomes.
