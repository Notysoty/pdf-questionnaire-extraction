Introduction 
 
INTROYPCAWI1 
{DISPLAY TO ALL} 
Thank you for logging on to complete the online questionnaire. 
 
Please make sure you have read the booklet we sent you, called “WHAT WOULD WE LIKE 
YOU TO DO? INFORMATION FOR STUDY MEMBERS”. If you don’t have it to hand, you can 
find a copy here. If you have any questions before you start the questionnaire, you can call 
the team on 0808 202 2102 or email childnc@ipsos.com.

How are you completing the questionnaire today? 
 
1 Online 
2 Over the phone with an interviewer 
 
 
INTROYPCAWI2 
{DISPLAY TO ALL} 
We’d like you to answer some questions about different things in your life. You can stop at 
any time. It is not a test so there are no right or wrong answers. If you don’t want to answer 
a question that’s ok, you can skip it.  If you wish to go back and change an answer that 
you’ve given, click ‘Back’.  It usually takes about 15 minutes. Some of the questions are 
about things that are personal so please make sure you fill in the questionnaire on your 
own. We’d like to remind you that all the answers you give will be completely confidential. 
We hope that you find the questions interesting and enjoy answering them.  
 
 

INTROYPCAWI3 
{DISPLAY TO ALL} 
Some questions are about things that are more personal. Remember no-one in your family 
will see your answers. If you come to a question that you don’t want to answer that’s ok. 
You can skip it and move to the next one by pressing ‘next’.  
 
Some questions are about things that not all young people your age will have done. That’s 
ok – we’re just as interested in what people haven’t done as well as what they have. It’s 
important that you answer honestly.
